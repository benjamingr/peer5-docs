## Development

The documentation is written using [`mkdocs`](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and requires Python installed.

Once Python, [pip](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17271319/) and Node are installed run:

```bash
pip install mkdocs
```

And then in the root repo folder:

```bash
mkdocs --serve
```

Which opens a development server.
