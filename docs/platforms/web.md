## HTML5 Web Integration

Peer5 can be integrated with any HTML5 video player and any media server that outputs HLS or DASH streams.

This guide assumes that you already have a media server that can output HLS or DASH streams. If this is not the case, we have a guide that explains how to set that up [for live video](guides/setting-up-hls-live-streaming-server-using-nginx/) as well as [for VoD](guides/production-ready-hls-vod/). In addition to nginx / nimble / ffmpeg, we also support (and recommend) [Wowza](guides/how-to-optimize-wowza-server/).

### Media Server and Digital Rights Management (DRM)

Peer5 is fully compatible with every media server and DRM technology. This means that integration with Peer5 requires no changes to your server side code.

### Video Player

Peer5 supports every HTML5 player. Among the free options, we recommend [Clappr](players/clappr/) or [Video.js](players/videojs/). Among the paid options, popular choices are [JWPlayer](players/jwplayer-7/) and [Bitmovin](players/bitmovin/).

Besides the standard players, we also work with most custom HLS / DASH players. If you'd like to check if your player is compatible with Peer5, please <a href="javascript:Intercom('show')">Chat with us</a> or [send us an email](mailto:info@peer5.com).

### Integration

After you've [signed up](https://app.peer5.com/register), please go to [the integration page](https://app.peer5.com/integration). Peer5 will analyze your website and video player and recommend the specific integration code to use.

### Architecture

Peer5 integrates with a broadcasterâ€™s existing infrastructure by deploying two lines of Javascript on the web page where the video player resides. This client-side Javascript implements a hybrid switcher. Once Peer5 is integrated, users can fetch video segments from either an edge server or from their peer group, depending on which channel is performing better at that given moment in time. As more chunk requests are handled by the peer group, the broadcaster sees dramatic reductions in server load and, consequently, higher stream quality (faster load times, less buffering, longer viewing sessions) for all viewers.

### Support

If you have any questions about integrating, please <a href="javascript:Intercom('show')">chat with us</a> or [send us an email](mailto:info@peer5.com).
