The integration with Peer5 plugin is easy and involves two lines of code.
In addition to the player script, include Peer5 client and the flowplayer plugin.
 
## Peer5 client and plugins scripts
add these two scripts to the `head` of your player's page
```html
<script src="//api.peer5.com/peer5.js?id=PEER5_API_KEY"></script>
<script src="//api.peer5.com/peer5.flowplayer.plugin.js"></script>
```
