## Android Integration

Peer5 integrates with Android very well and integration is straightforward and easy.

### Hybrid Application

Since a hybrid application is just an HTML5 application in disguise Peer5 will work out of the box with hybrid applications. In the same page or view in which you initialize your video player - include the Peer5 scripts.

Delivery of P2P content will work on all Android versions from 5.0 and up (versions with WebRTC support). 

### Native Application

Peer5 has a thin native Android SDK that is embeddable in your native app. The Peer5 Android SDK works with any Android player although we recommend [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer) which we've found to give good playback results.

At the moment, Android SDK integration is available to premium customers. If you'd like to apply please [fill out this form](https://www.peer5.com/mobile).
