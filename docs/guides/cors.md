## Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
 
[CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
is a mechanism that allows restricted resources (e.g. fonts) on a web page 
to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated.
 
**Peer5** performs requests from your video page to your video server,  
for best performance it is required that your video server will respond with the following headers per request type:

`GET`

  - `'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'`: `'*'`
  - `'Access-Control-Expose-Headers'`: `'Content-Length, Content-Range'`

---

`HEAD`

  - `'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'`: `'*'`
  - `'Access-Control-Expose-Headers'`: `'Content-Length'`

---

`OPTIONS`  
<small>options requests (sometime called preflight) are performed in many common browsers like Chrome and Firefox.</small>
  
  - `'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'`: `'*'`
  - `'Access-Control-Allow-Methods'`: `'GET, HEAD, OPTIONS'`
  - `'Content-Length'`: `'0'`  
    
status: `200` | `204`
