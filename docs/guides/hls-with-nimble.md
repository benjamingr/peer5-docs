# HLS With Nimble

## Intro
[Nimble Streamer](https://wmspanel.com/nimble) is a fantastic lightweight media server
with its own live [transcoder](https://wmspanel.com/transcoder) and [WMSPanel](https://wmspanel.com/admin_panel) web control UI.
We are going to show how to configure Nimble and stream HLS with Peer5. The MPEG-DASH is set up the same way.

Prior to following this article, please install Nimble Streamer on any supported OS.

## Setup CORS 
Peer5 needs CORS to get the video segments from your server:

1. Open your config file (Usually located at `/etc/nimble/nimble.conf`).
2. Add the following lines at the bottom of the file:
	+ `access_control_allow_origin = *`
	+ `access_control_expose_headers = Content-Length`
3. Save the file.
4. Restart the nimble service using this command: `sudo service nimble restart`.

## Setup VOD HLS Stream
1. Copy the mp4 video file you want to stream to a path that will be accessible by the nimble user on your server, Lets say `/var/www/video/`.
2. On the navigation panel: `Nimble streamer -> Edit nimble routes`.
