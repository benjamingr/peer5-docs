# Migrate From Flash

Starting version 55 of Chrome (release in Dec 2016) browser flash is becoming an opt-in plugin meaning that user will need to explicitly activate flash plugin.
If you are using flash based HLS media player its a good idea to migrate to HTML5 based one.
This guide will explain the easiest solutions for most of the common players.

## Do I Use Flash?

If you are using RTMP you are using Flash.

If you are using HLS follow the next steps to check if you're using Flash.

1. Navigate to your page that contains the video player and start playing
2. Right click on the playing video area

if you see something like `Flash Version x.x.x` or `Adobe x.x.x` it means you are using flash

if you see a regular browser menu and you can 'inspect element' in chrome that means you are using HTML5 

## HLS Migration Table

A word of caution - even if your player supports HTML5, you should actually test that your stream works with its html5 tech.

### JWPlayer7 Tuning

Starting v7.4.2 its possible to enable html5 rendering for HLS - hence v7.4.2 is the minimal version for html5 HLS playback.
To tune JWPlayer v7 to use html5 by default add the following configs to your player initiation

```
{
  primary: 'html5',
  hlshtml: true
}
```

### VideoJS5 Tuning

VideoJS v5 needs a plugin to play hls, if you are using either one of these - then you are already using html5 based playback

### Flowplayer Tuning

Flowplayer v6 supports HLS playback using flash or through native HLS support such as in safari.
To use Flowplayer with html5 HLS playback you must add the [hlsjs plugin](https://flowplayer.org/docs/plugins.html#hlsjs) or to use [Peer5](/players/flowplayer/)

## RTMP Migration

Since RTMP is a proprietary protocol of Adobe its not possible to play RTMP without flash plugin.
There are some attempts to replace RTMP with WebRTC as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37457972/low-latency-2s-live-video-streaming-html5-solutions)
yet no mature solution has been presented yet.
The most viable solution to replace RTMP streaming is to use HLS.

HLS is supported in many media servers - [read more](/faq/#how-do-i-setup-an-hlsdash-stream)
